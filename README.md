# ESP8266-and-Arduino-Projects
Projects for public consumption for ESP8266 and Arduino
First project is a ESP8266 garage door opener inspired by:
    https://startingelectronics.org/tutorials/arduino/ethernet-shield-web-server-tutorial/SD-card-IO/
    and
    John Murphy   https://bitbucket.org/hystericallyMad/esp8266-web-server
    
You might be best served to check both of these projects out since this one copies heavily from both.
